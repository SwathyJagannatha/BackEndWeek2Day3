# 3.Loop Condition Logic
# Task 2: Conditional Exit Create a while loop that will terminate after 5 iterations, and each iteration you print which iteration it is on. (use a control variable)

iteration = 0

while(iteration < 5):
    print("Printing iterations")
    iteration = iteration + 1
    print(f"Hey, You are currently on {iteration} iteration")
